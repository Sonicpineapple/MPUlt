# Building
You can clone this repo and build using Microsoft Visual Studio.  However, you will need to install an older version of the DirectX libraries to get the references to work.  That install can be found here:

It would be nice to modernize the DirectX usage.  Some notes about replacement packages are available here:

Sample configuration files are included in the config directory.  To see all the puzzles, you will want to copy these to the directory where the built executable lives.
